# DynamicDanceCostume
This is a repository for the final project for the course DES130: Introduction to Engineering Design at IIIT-Delhi in the Winter '19 Semester. 

Aim: To develop and prototype a light-weight low-cost Tron Dance costume that changes its appearance according to your movements. 

Prototyping: To show proof of concept, we developed an initial prototype, using the Arduino Lilypad as the microcontroller for the project, due to it's light weight and smart-wearable friendly design. From this, we developed a circuit design that placed the arduino and all the flex-sensors and the associated LEDs and resistors on a basic full-sleeve TShirt. 

Product: You can find the videos included in the repository demonstrating the working of the prototype.
